# 2D Convolution Processor Design (Final Project)

This repository contains the Verilog implementation and fixed-point simulation results of a 2D Convolution Processor, developed as the final project for the **Hardware Description Languages** course.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

We designed and implemented a two-dimensional convolution processor that performs kernel-based filtering on input image data.  
The processor supports different kernel sizes and can be configured to operate in various hardware architectures (Architecture 1, 2, and 3).

---

## 📌 Features

- Supports **3×3** and **5×5** kernel convolution
- Fixed-point data processing: **8-bit input → 16-bit output**
- Achieves **SQNR > 30 dB**
- Includes Verilog simulation and testbench
- Implements three architecture variants

## ▶️ How to Simulate

You can simulate the design using **ModelSim** or **Icarus Verilog**:

```bash
# Compile
iverilog -o sim_out src/*.v tb/tb_top.v

# Run simulation
vvp sim_out

# View waveform
gtkwave dump.vcd

## 🧪 Fixed-point Validation

* Floating-point results were calculated using Python / C / Excel
* Fixed-point outputs were derived and validated
* Achieved **SQNR (Signal-to-Quantization-Noise Ratio) > 30 dB**
