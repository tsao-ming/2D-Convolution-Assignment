# 2D Convolution Processor Design (Final Project)

This repository contains the Verilog implementation and fixed-point simulation results of a 2D Convolution Processor, developed as the final project for the **Hardware Description Languages** course.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

We designed and implemented a two-dimensional convolution processor that performs kernel-based filtering on input image data.  
The processor supports different kernel sizes and can be configured to operate in various hardware architectures (Architecture 1, 2, and 3).

---

## 📌 Features

- Supports **3×3** and **5×5** kernel convolution
- Fixed-point data processing: **8-bit input → 16-bit output**
- Achieves **SQNR > 30 dB**
- Includes Verilog simulation and testbench
- Implements three architecture variants

## 🏗️ Architecture 3 — Extended Design Description

In this project, we adopted **Architecture 3** to implement an extendable 2D convolution processor. This architecture allows both the input feature maps (IFMD) and kernel weights (KW) to be dynamically written into internal memory by the **Testbench (TM)**, supporting flexible data loading and reuse.

To enhance functionality, we further extended the design to support the following:

---

### ✅ a. Multi-Input Feature Map Convolution ("One Layer")

Our processor supports **multi-channel input and multi-output convolution**, allowing it to simulate the behavior of a complete convolutional layer.

* In our implementation, the TM writes **2 input feature maps (IFMDs)** into memory.
* Each IFMD is paired with **2 different kernel weight matrices (KWs)**, forming **4 sets of convolutions**.
* The processor performs convolution for each (IFMD, KW) pair, and the results are combined to produce **2 output feature maps (OFMs)**.
* Each OFM is computed by summing the results from both input feature maps with their corresponding kernels:

  $$
  OFM_1 = IFMD_1 \ast KW_{1,1} + IFMD_2 \ast KW_{2,1}  \\
  OFM_2 = IFMD_1 \ast KW_{1,2} + IFMD_2 \ast KW_{2,2}
  $$

### ✅ b. Configurable Kernel Size (3×3 or 5×5)

We implemented a **kernel-size configurable design**, controlled by an `is_5x5` input signal:

* When `is_5x5 = 0`, the processor performs **3×3 convolution**
* When `is_5x5 = 1`, it performs **5×5 convolution**

---

### 🧠 Summary

By extending **Architecture 3**, our implementation supports both:

* **Multi-channel convolution (layer-level processing)**
* **Runtime kernel-size switching**

## ▶️ How to Simulate

You can simulate the design using **ModelSim** or **Icarus Verilog**:

```bash
# Compile
iverilog -f .\filelist.txt

# Run simulation
vvp a.out

# View waveform
gtkwave .\bench_wave.vcd
````

## 🧪 Fixed-point Validation

* Floating-point results were calculated using Python / C / Excel
* Fixed-point outputs were derived and validated
* Achieved **SQNR (Signal-to-Quantization-Noise Ratio) > 30 dB**
